# Installation

You can install this extension on Chromium-based browsers (like Brave and Chrome) and Firefox.

## For Chromium-based Browsers (Brave, Google Chrome)

1. Download the Extension:
  - Go to the Releases page.
  - Download the .zip file from the latest release.
2. Extract the Files:
  - Unzip the downloaded file into a folder you can easily locate.
3. Load the Extension in Your Browser:
  - Open your browser and navigate to chrome://extensions or brave://extensions.
  - Enable Developer mode using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
  - Click on the Load unpacked button.
  - Select the folder where you extracted the extension files.

The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

## For Firefox
### Option 1: Developer Edition + about:config (Easiest)

  - A warning message may appear. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue".
